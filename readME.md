# Start of something awesome
The goal is to hear the actual words of our family members. Ideally we would talk to them, but if they have passed on, then it is not an easy feat. However, is it impossible?

No.

Not with today's technology.

Coupled with the power of AI we can take the written word, a few voice threads, and create a virtual version of our ancestors.

My wife's grandmother had a great effect on her. She was a lovely lady who had the resiliancy of someone who grew up during the great depression. Frugal, stalwart, and even perhaps stubborn at times but in an endearing way.

What we have left of hers are her journal writings. Handwritten journal entries.

# Steps
1. Gather each word and create an ML model specific to her hand writing
    1. Create an index where other family members can help index each word for me via hugging face
    2. Use [fast.ai](fast.ai) to create the model
2. Create embeddings of all of her writings by date
3. Create a chatbot to act and answer only from her writings
3. Train a voice model to actually respond in her voice
